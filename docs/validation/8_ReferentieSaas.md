# Towards a SAAS solution for validating ICDD containers

If an phased approach for the development of an ICDD validation service is desirable then roughly the following approach can be suggested.

1) Develop a SAAS ICDD validation service without support for versions and owl:sameAs
2) Introduce the missing functionality (version and owl:sameAs)

For testing the SAAS it can be recommended to develop test containers. For example create a container for each check.


2. create a reference validation system
    1.1 online or easy accessible
    1.2 publish the checks it performs
    1.3 organise the necessary support
    1.4 organise a quick support capacity for dealing with disputable containers
