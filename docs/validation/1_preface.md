# Preface

NEN-EN-ISO 21597-1:2020 can be regarded as an information exchange standard for exchanging multiple documents in conjunction in a single package. This single package is called a container, or an ICDD container, within this standard and needs to comply with the NEN-EN-ISO 21597-1:2020.

This document describes a set of tests to validate if containers comply with the NEN-EN-ISO 21597-1:2020. The tests are detailed so that they can be used as a starting point for software developers.
