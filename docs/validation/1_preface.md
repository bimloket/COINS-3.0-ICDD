# Preface

NEN-EN-ISO 21597-1:2020 can be regarded as an information exchange standard for exchanging multiple documents in conjunction with a single package. This single package is called a container, or an ICDD container in this document. Such a container needs to comply with the NEN-EN-ISO 21597-1:2020.

This document describes a set of tests to validate if containers comply with the NEN-EN-ISO 21597-1:2020. These tests comprise of descriptions that can be a starting point for software developers. It also layouts a shacl-based approach for testing NEN-EN-ISO 21597-1:2020 RDF data in the containers. Example Shacl files are available.
